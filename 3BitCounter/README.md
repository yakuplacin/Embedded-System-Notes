This project is about the binary counter with a button. 
The proteus project will show the last 3 bits of the current number of counter.
For example, if the button is pressed 3 times, 3 is 00..11 in binary, pin 1 and pin 2 will give high so that LED1 and LED2 will give light.
If you continue to press the button, total of 10 for example, in binary it will be 00..1010. Here, the last 3 bits are 010 so that only LED2 will blink.
